# Kaggle-prediction-of-user-transportation-mode

This program will work on the prediction of user's transportation mode considering an IoT data set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/fschwartzer/tmd-dataset-5-seconds-sliding-window) and it will explore three classification methods : k nearest neighbors (KNN), bayesian classifier and Naive-Bayes classifier. All of these methods were tested under different setups and input data. This process will be clearer along the python notebook.

All of the clarifications about the data and classification and prediction methods will be done along the python notebook. I hope you guys like it !
